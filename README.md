# Reflection:
1. I made an endless 3D FPS game where the player is tasked with destroying code snippets as they slowly take over the map. It has a health system, movements, and a kill count.
2. I used HTML and JavaScript
3 and 4. I used ChatGPT to generate the base code for the environment and to get advice on how to integrate certain aspects of the game, mostly enemy pathfinding, the 3d environment, and the rendering engine. I worked on integrating the assets, refining the movement, and made sure the code ChatGPT gave me meshes well together.
5. I am most proud of how well the codebase came together. I was able to follow most of the code ChatGPT gave me, and whenever there was a problem, tracking and solving it wasn't that hard.
6. Scope creep got a hold of me in this project. I originally wanted to add multiple levels and enemy projectiles, but I spent so much time attempting to refine the other enemy behaviors and rendering issues that I couldn't get it done. By the time we had 30 minutes left, I realized I hadn't even started on the title screen.
